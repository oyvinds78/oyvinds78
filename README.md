# About me ðŸ‘‹






- Been studying Applied Machine Learning since October 2023.
- Currently started working on my final exam project. 
- Using Github mainly private, as I feel I need some more experience.
- Keeping myself up to date within the AI and machine learning world, constantly testing new applications, tools and models. Lot of trial and error.
- Excited for the future of AI.
- Know the Python basics, and most familiar to libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and seaborn, but familiar to many others.
- Familiar with no-code and low-code tools, as well as coding tools and AI agents.
- Familiar with MCPs.
- I've spent 20 years in the restaurant business before I decided to study machine learning.
